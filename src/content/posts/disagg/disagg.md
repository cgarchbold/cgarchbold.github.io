# Abstract:

The monetary value of a given piece of real estate, a parcel, is often readily available from a geographic information system. However, for many applications, such as insurance and urban planning, it is useful to have estimates of property value at much higher spatial resolutions. We propose a method to estimate the distribution over property value at the pixel level from remote sensing imagery. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of a major urban area. Our results show that the proposed approaches are capable of generating fine-level estimates of property values, significantly improving upon a diverse collection of baseline approaches

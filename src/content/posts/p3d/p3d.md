# Abstract:
Limited data-availability and ethical concerns regarding individual privacy hinder large-scale understanding of protests using social media data. Current AI methods are capable of identifying faces, understanding complex scenes and objects, and cross-referencing vast amount of this information across diverse social networks. This presents an ethical concern, as large foundation models trained on these social media data can memorize and disclose sensitive information about the identities and actions of protesters. To our knowledge, unfortunately, no existing protest analysis method takes privacy into consideration. To close this gap, we propose a simple and robust framework for understanding protest dynamics with privacy preservation, namely privacy preserving protest dynamics (P3D). Our P3D framework aims to replace private data with well-labeled synthetic reproductions using conditional image synthesis. Extensive evaluation of the proposed P3D method demonstrates its ability to generate realistic and diverse imagery, and its efficacy in utility and privacy preservation for downstream protest analysis. Unlike other state-of-the-art privacy preserving techniques, P3D can provide a moderate level of privacy protection by modeling complex visual features in protest images while maintaining downstream utility.

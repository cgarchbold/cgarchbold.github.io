# About
Hi! I’m Cohen Archbold, a PhD student in Computer Science with a focus on machine learning and task-driven computer vision. My research aims to address modern vision challenges through the lens of privacy, fairness, and interpretability.

My current work explores the integration of differential privacy into computer vision systems, with particular emphasis on private generative modeling, fairness-aware learning, and explainable AI. I’m especially interested in building systems that not only perform well but also respect ethical boundaries and societal values.

Beyond research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring, writing about ML topics, and contributing to open-source projects.

Feel free to connect or check out my work:
